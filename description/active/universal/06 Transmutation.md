Combine your badges to generate new ones with transmutation!  

**Transmute your badges** using: */w tpp transmute [badge], [badge], [badge], â€¦, t1* 
(separated by commas)

* Costs at least 1 token
* Minimum 3 badges, maximum 20 badges
* As of now, only Generation 1, 2 and 3 badges can be transmutated
* Transmute will happen on-screen
* Your new badge will be awarded to you in-chat
* Both number of badges and rarity affect the outcome
* Sacrifice less common badges for a greater chance of creating a rare badge!
